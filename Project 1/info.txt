CDM (Conceptual Data Model):

The Conceptual Data Model is the highest-level data model in the data modeling process.
It focuses on understanding and representing the essential business concepts and the relationships between them, regardless of the technical details or implementation considerations.
CDM is often used to communicate with non-technical stakeholders and to establish a common understanding of the business requirements.
It doesn't involve detailed attributes or specific data types but rather provides a high-level view of the data and its interconnections.
LDM (Logical Data Model):

The Logical Data Model is the next stage in the data modeling process, following the conceptual model.
It takes the concepts and relationships identified in the CDM and refines them to include more specific details.
LDM defines entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints in a technology-neutral manner. It doesn't consider the specific database management system or implementation details.
This model serves as an intermediate step between the conceptual model and the physical data model.
PDM (Physical Data Model):

The Physical Data Model is the lowest-level data model in the data modeling process.
It represents the data structures and organization as they will be implemented in a particular database management system (DBMS).
PDM includes details like table structures, data types, indexes, keys, and storage considerations.
It is closely tied to the specific database technology chosen for implementation, making it more technical and less abstract compared to the CDM and LDM.
In summary, CDM provides a high-level, business-oriented view of data, LDM refines the model to include logical details, and PDM specifies the physical implementation details for a specific database system. These models are essential for designing effective databases that meet business requirements while also being technically sound.
